# Deciphering Big data

## This module has deepened my understanding of how to work with large, complex datasetsâ€”from raw collection to clean, usable formats ready for analysis. We've explored a wide range of data types and sources, and examined how to apply data wrangling techniques like cleansing, normalisation, and transformation to remove redundancies and prepare data for real-world use. This hands-on learning has not only strengthened my technical skills, but also sharpened my ability to assess data quality and choose the right tools and methods for different scenarios.
